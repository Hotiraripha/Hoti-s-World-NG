## Description

Welcome to the WIP version of Hoti's World Reborn! This update, dubbed "Hoti's World Reborn," is designed to enhance the previous Hoti's World modlist with support for the latest Fallout 4 updates, new Wabbajack versions, and modern modding practices. Please read everything carefully before installation.

## Pre-Installation

If you’ve previously played mods like *Fallout London*, **ensure you have a clean, unmodified installation of Fallout 4**:

- 🔧 **Creation Kit Requirement**: As of the v0.5 update, you **must** have the Creation Kit for Fallout 4 installed to proceed with the installation of the modlist.
- 🔧 **Vanilla Version**: Make sure your Fallout 4 game is fully updated and unmodified. Regenerate INI files for a fresh start.
- 💻 **Initial Launch**: Run the game at least once before installation to configure your graphical settings.

For further details, refer to the [Wabbajack Installation Guide](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/wiki/Installation) and [MO2 User Guide](https://modding.wiki/en/modding-guides/mod-organizer-2).

## Specifications (as of August 2024)

- 💾 **Storage**: You will need a total of 370 GB of available storage.
- 🚀 **Drive**: Install Hoti’s World NG on either a SATA or NVMe SSD. HDDs or SSHDDs are not supported.
- 🖥 **GPU**: While the modlist doesn’t demand more VRAM than vanilla Fallout 4, an 8 GB GPU (e.g., RX 5700, GTX 1080 Ti, or better) is recommended.
- 🧠 **RAM**: A minimum of 32 GB is required.
- ⚙️ **CPU**: A 6-core processor (e.g., i5-10400F or R5 3600) is adequate. Higher single-threaded performance will yield better results.

## Post-Installation

- **Initial Setup**: Launch the Fallout 4 launcher through Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) to set your graphical settings. Afterward, close the launcher and start F4SE.
- **NVIDIA Users**: Enable the mod weapon debris crash fix in the mods section of mod organizer 2, otherwise you will experience crashes.
- **IMPORTANT**: once you load into the game with the "Start Game" option, and create your character, you want to select **YES** when the game asks you if you want to let the game load mods, and once it has finished and you have talked to the robot who engages in a conversation with you, wait until all the pop ups have disappeared, once that  has happened, please save your game, not quicksave, normal save.

## Gameplay
- **Gameplay Flow**: Please remember to spec early into the skills and perks you wish to use, as otherwise, if you go for a balanced character from the get go, thanks to the mod " You Are Exceptional " you will not do much if any damage, as that is the perks overhaul and system Hotisworld NG, the modlist in question, uses. I recommend a minimum of 40 points into the specific skills you wish to use. and pic the trait named "**Military Training**" which further boosts your skills by 10 points, enabling you to do more damage early on in the game.

## Modifications

- **Updating Mods**: When adding or updating mods, mark them with the `[NoDelete]` flag in MO2 to prevent them from being removed during updates. For example, rename your mod to `[NoDelete] XM2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle`.
- **PSA**: Many wabbajack lists do not offer support for modified lists by the user, so please do mention ahead of time if you have added any or removed any mods from the list, as that will disqualify you from support, the modlsit has been designed to play well with everything that is enabled.

## Feedback and Community

Your feedback is valuable! Share your thoughts or suggestions in the comments or on our WIP server, "Hoti's World Reborn." While I prioritize my vision for an ideal Fallout experience, I’m open to incorporating useful tools and suggestions.
