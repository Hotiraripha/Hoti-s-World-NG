## Description

Welcome to the WIP version of Hoti's World NG! This update, dubbed "Hoti's World NG," is designed to enhance the previous Hoti's World modlist with support for the latest Fallout 4 updates, new Wabbajack versions, and modern modding practices. Please read everything carefully before installation.

## Pre-Installation

If you‚Äôve previously played mods like Fallout London, ensure you have a clean, unmodified installation of Fallout 4:

- üîß **Vanilla Version**: Make sure it‚Äôs fully updated and unmodified, with regenerated INI files.
- üíª **Initial Launch**: Launch the game at least once and configure your graphical settings.

For more information, check out the [Wabbajack Installation Guide](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/wiki/Installation) and the [MO2 User Guide](https://modding.wiki/en/modding-guides/mod-organizer-2).

## Specifications (as of August 2024)

- üíæ **Storage**: You will need a total of 370 GB of available storage.
- üöÄ **Drive**: Install Hoti‚Äôs World NG on either a SATA or NVMe SSD. HDDs or SSHDDs are not supported.
- üñ• **GPU**: While the modlist doesn‚Äôt demand more VRAM than vanilla Fallout 4, an 8 GB GPU (e.g., RX 5700, GTX 1080 Ti, or better) is recommended.
- üß† **RAM**: A minimum of 32 GB is required.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **CPU**: A 6-core processor (e.g., i5-10400F or R5 3600) is adequate. Higher single-threaded performance will yield better results.

## Post-Installation

1. **Initial Setup**: Launch the Fallout 4 launcher through Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) to set your graphical settings. Afterward, close the launcher and start F4SE.
2. **Display Configuration**: The modlist is preconfigured for Super Ultrawide displays (32:9). You may need to disable certain mods for different setups:
   - Original Main Menu Video in 32:9
   - Super Ultra Wide Interface (32x9)
   - Original Intro Videos in 32x9

## Modifications

- **Updating Mods**: When adding or updating mods, mark them with the `[NoDelete]` flag in MO2 to prevent them from being removed during updates. For example, rename your mod to `[NoDelete] XM2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle`.

## Feedback and Community

Your feedback is valuable! Share your thoughts or suggestions in the comments or on our WIP server, "Hoti's World Reborn." While I prioritize my vision for an ideal Fallout experience, I‚Äôm open to incorporating useful tools and suggestions.
