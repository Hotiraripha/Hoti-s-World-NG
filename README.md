# Hoti-s-World-NG

DESCRIPTION, READ EVERYTHING
PRE INSTALLATION: If you have played mods such as fallout london, make sure to have a vanilla version of un-downgraded fallout 4, fully vanila installation that has regenerated ini files, make also sure to have launched the game at least once and selected your graphical settings.


This is a WIP for the upcoming version of HotisWorld, dubbed Hotisworld 'NG' it aims to do something similar to the previous hotisworld modlist, but be updated to support the recent next gen update of Fallout 4, newer wabbajack versions, newer modding methodologies and mindsets that I have adopted during the break from hotisworld.

It aims to also be more polished, but still something I would personally play, do not install it if you don't want to try likely buggy and beta modlists, or don't want to start many saves, install right now only if you feel comfortbale providing ample feedback and constructive criticism.

I have been working on this for the past few months, remaking it and deleting, trying to get a hang on for how stock game works, so you will need quite a bit of storage for this.


SPECS discussion as of August 2024:

150GB for the modlist itself and 40GB for Fallout 4 from steam ONLY, GOG is not supported as of now.

you will also need to have installed hotisworld on either a sata or nvme SSD, HDDs or SSHDD are not supported.

The list as of 31/08/2024 does not require much more VRAM than vanilla Fallout 4, but I still recommend an 8GB GPU , Rx 5700/ GTX 1080ti and above,

as the list is under development, you will want to have more than enough ram, so 32GB is a must.

a 6 core CPU (i5 10400f or R5 3600) and above will do, but of course the better single threaded performance your cpu can pump out the better.

POST INSTALLATION: 

Make sure to launch the fallout 4 launcher at least once through mod organizer 2 (the launcher) and select your graphical settings. after you have done that, close the fallout 4 launcher and launch F4SE

The modlist is preconfigured for Super Ultrawide displays (32:9) as that is what I have right now, but you can disable certain mods I will make optional as the modlist updates roll out.

You will need to disable these mods:
Original Main Menu video in 32:9
Smaller UI size
Original intro videos



I do take feedback which you can write in the comment section or in this WIP server for Hotisworld NG ''Hoti's World Reborn'' where you can directly tell me about changes or improvements you would like to see, but please keep in mind I will not make something I would not play, my vision comes first for the ideal Fallout, but I will also give you the freedom to play however you please by giving  you said tools.

thank you for reading.
